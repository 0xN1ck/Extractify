## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application offers a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy to navigate and use.

- **File Selection:** Choose a main directory using the provided directory picker. The application allows you to select specific files and directories within the chosen main directory.

- **Report Generation:** Generate a report containing the content of the selected files. The report is saved as a text file, providing a consolidated view of the chosen files.

- **Limited Scope:** Please note that Extractify is not optimized for handling a large number of files. It is recommended for scenarios where the number of files to be processed is moderate.

## Usage

   - Click on the "Choose main directory..." placeholder and select the desired main directory using the folder picker.

2. **Select Files:**
   - Navigate through the directory tree displayed in the application.

5. **View Report:**
   - The status bar at the bottom of the application provides a clickable link to open the generated report in your default text file viewer.

## Limitations

- **Not Suitable for Large Datasets:** Extractify is designed for scenarios where the number of files is not excessively large. It may not provide optimal performance for handling a massive number of files.

- **Text Files Only:** The application generates reports in text file format (.txt).
